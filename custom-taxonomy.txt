The custom genre taxonomy used by this script is:

        "blues",
        "childrens.music",
        "classical",
        "country",
        "electronic",
        "folk",
        "hip.hop",
        "jazz",
        "lounge",
        "metal",
        "noise",
        "non.music",
        "pop",
        "post.rock",
        "punk.ska",
        "rock",
        "rhythm.and.blues",
        "soundtrack",
        "world.music",

All of the styles in the genre-map.csv are based on this list.  You can change it in the separate_genres function but you will also need to adjust or add to the genre-map.csv file.  All other tags not listed in this list will get added to the STYLE comment as oppposed to the GENRE one.

It is closely based on the discogs taxonomy but customized to my taste and needs.  Discogs defines their taxonomy here:
